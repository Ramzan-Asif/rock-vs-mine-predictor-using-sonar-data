# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data 🎯

This project uses supervised machine learning to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines** (underwater explosives), based on the features extracted from sonar readings. This can be a simple demonstration of binary classification using Logistic Regression.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📊 **Dataset**: Sonar data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- 🤖 **Model**: Logistic Regression (can be swapped with SVM, Decision Trees, etc.).
- 🧠 **Goal**: Predict whether a sonar signal is from a rock or a mine.
- ⚙️ **Evaluation**: Accuracy score on training and test sets.
- ✅ **Input format**: 60 numerical features per sonar signal.
- 📈 **Tool used**: Jupyter Notebook + scikit-learn.

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ramzan-Asif/rock-vs-mine-predictor-using-sonar-data.git
   cd rock-vs-mine-predictor-using-sonar-data

2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook:
    jupyter notebook Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction_ML_Project.ipynb

🚀 Output Example
    The model takes 60 sonar readings and predicts:
    The predited value is:  ['R']
    The object is Rock!
